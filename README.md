# Pancreas model
This repository provides the model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell.

The model is distributed as [SBML](http://sbml.org) available from [`pancreas_deepa.xml`](./models/pancreas_deepa.xml) with 
corresponding SBML4humans model report at [https://sbml4humans.de/model_url?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthiaskoenig/pancreas-model/main/models/pancreas_deepa.xml](https://sbml4humans.de/model_url?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthiaskoenig/pancreas-model/main/models/pancreas_deepa.xml)
